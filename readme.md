# Religious Fitness

My goal with this project was to create an attractive site for a gym in London.
The gym is open to everyone and has a range of classes, from beginner to advanced, that members can sign up for.
The site also has info on history, equipment, opening hours, location, a schedule for classes and some info on the classes from the trainers who run them.
Finally the site will feature a contact form and social media links.

## UX

The goal of this site is to maximise users of the gym ensuring that anyone who wants to use it can find everything they need to start doing so and also to increase the number of members by having
non-members sign up.

Users of this site will be members and non-members, who just want to work-out, and members who want to book a class.

Non-members can check the equipment, opening hours/location and use the gym facilities upon paying an entry fee.
Non-members can pay the entry fee in advance or pay for 10 enteries at a discounted price. 
Also non-members can see offers, read testimonials and potentially sign up for membership.
The same can be said for members except they get free entry and priority if there's limited space. 
Members can also book classes from a range of classes, from begginer to advanced. 
These user-types will be enticed by our prices, impressed with our facilities/testimonials/classes, and will find all the info they need, logically laid out, to start using our gym.

Info will be grouped into four pages, home, schedule, about, and contact. The homepage will feature our prices, offers for potential members,
and testimonials from existing members. Grouping these pieces of info will hopefully encourage non-members to sign up for membership.
The schedule page will feature a timetable of the classes, a phone number to make a booking, and some info on the classes from the trainers who run them.
Everything a member needs to book a class is on this page.
The about page will feature some info on the gym for those interested. It will go more in-depth about the opening hours, equipment, history and the classes.
Finally the contact page will feature a map with the gym's location, a contact form for those who need to ask us something, and some links to our social media and what users will find there.

The homepage will feature picutres of happy people exercising to convey the feeling that our gym is a nice place to exercise
and the theme of the site will be blue and white for the same reason.

The schedule page will have a timetable for the classes and some info about said classes, with a picture of the trainers next to the info.
This will help members find a class that suits them. The pictures/text will hopefully encourage members to book a class by establishing a personal connection with the trainers.

The about page will feature a section about the equipment with a picture. To let users know about all the equipment the gym has.
And finally a section about the classes and trainers who run them with a picture.

The contact page will have a picture map of our location but possible in the futre an interactive google maps one with an option for directions.
It will have a contact for with a required email field so we can reply to queries through users email.

I will use Bootstrap as a mobile-first framework for fast building and designing of the site.

### User Stories:

    1) As a non-member I want to use the gym facilities. I potentially pay the entry fee now. I potential check opening hours, location, and equipment on about/contact pages.

    2) As a non-member I want to sign up for membership. I have used the gym before so I know it has all the right stuff or I check the about/contact pages to make sure it does. 
    I read the testimonials to see what existing members have to say about the gym. I possibly check the schedule to see if there is a class that is suitable for me. 
    I click the button to sign up for membership.

    3) As a member I want to book a class. I check the schedule to see if there is a class that suits my experience level and is at a time when I am available.
    I phone the number and book a class.

    4) As a user I need to know something about the gym which is not specified on any of the pages. I use the contact form to ask, filling out both the required email and textarea fields.

## Testing

- Throughout the building process I have been using chrome so I know for sure everything is working as intended in google chrome browser. I have also tested on Firefox and Edge to ensure
everything loads properly and works as intended. 

### User Stories Tests

    1) Navbar works and allows users to navigate through the site's pages for relevant info. Payment buttons on homepage are present but do not do anything at the moment.

    2) Navbar allows user to move to relevant pages for info. Testimonials display below offers with the headline visible on the homepage. Buttons are there but do not go anywhere/do anything at the moment.

    3) From homepage go to schedule page. The number and table display all relevant info. They work on all screen sizes.

    4) From homepage clock on contact page. Fill out contact form. Form does not send without the two required fields being filled out, email and textarea, as intended. Add email and question in textarea field and it works.

### Bugs Discovered

- Navbar and footer not the same shade of blue. Navbar on homepage slightly lighter than navbar on other three pages.

- ~~Navbar toggler not working on smaller screen sizes.~~ Fixed - was using older attribute *data-toggle* rather than *data-bs-toggle* which Bootstrap 5 uses.

- ~~Navbar hidden by content when expanded on homepage.~~ Fixed - changed content to relative position.

## Deployment
