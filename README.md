# Religious Fitness

My goal with this project was to create an attractive site for a fake gym in London. The gym is open to everyone and has a range of classes, from beginner to advanced, that members can sign up for.
The site also has info on equipment, opening hours, location and a schedule for classes.

## UX

The goal of this site is to maximise users of the gym ensuring that anyone who wants to use it can find everything they need to start doing so and also to increase the number of members by having
non-members sign up.

Users of this site will be members and non-members, who just want to work-out, and members who want to book a class.

Non-members can check the equipment, opening hours/location and use the gym facilities upon paying an entry fee. 
Non-members can also see offers, read testimonials and potentially sign up for membership.
The same can be said for members except they get free entry. 
Members can also book classes from a range of classes, ranging from begginer to advanced. 
These user-types will be enticed by our prices, impressed with our facilities/testimonials/classes, and will find all the info they need, logically laid out, to start using our gym.

Info will be grouped into three pages, home, schedule and about. The homepage will feature offers for potential members,
info on the equipment, and testimonials from existing members. Grouping these pieces of info will hopefully encourage non-members to sign up for membership.
The schedule page will feature a timetable of the classes, and a phone number to make a booking. Everything a member needs to book a class is on this page.
The about page will feature all the info a user could want. It will go more in-depth about the equipment, location/opening hours and the classes.

The homepage will feature picutres of happy people exercising to convey the feeling that our gym is a nice place to exercise
and the theme of the site will be blue and white.

### User Stories:
